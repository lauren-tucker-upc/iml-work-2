To run our code you should go in the terminal to the 'src/experiments' directory and run the following commands:

- To run the first experiment PCA & FA Comparison:
    - python master_analysis.py -exp 'FRC' -ds 'pen-based' -nv 3 -nco 16

- To run the second experiment Clustering with dimensionality reduction:
    - python master_analysis.py -exp 'FRC' -ds 'pen-based' -nv 3 -nco 16

To replicate our results you can run the comands in the file 'src/experiments/commands.md'
